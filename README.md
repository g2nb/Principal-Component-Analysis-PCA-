# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a method that reduces the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most of its variation. 
It accomplishes this by identifying directions, called principal components, along which the variation in the data is maximal. 
By using a few components, each sample can be represented by relatively few numbers instead of by values for thousands of variables. 
Samples can then be plotted, making it possible to visually assess similarities and differences between samples and determine whether samples can be grouped.
